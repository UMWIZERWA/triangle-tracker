    <h1>TRIANGLE-TRACKER</h1>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Triangle</strong> is a three-sided polygon. This closed figure consists of three lines which are linked at the endpoint to each other. The main properties of the triangle are that the sum of the interior angle of the triangle will be 180° and the sum of the exterior angles will be 360° always. Triangle can be classified according to their sides and interior angles.</p>
    <h2>Types of Triangles with Respect to Sides</h2>
    <h3>Equilateral Triangle</h3>
    <p>This type of triangle consists of three equal sides and equal angles. Every side of the triangle is of the same length and every angle will be of the same measure of 60°. The following figure is an equilateral triangle </p>

    <h3>Isosceles triangle</h3>
    <p>The triangle with only two equal sides is known as the isosceles triangle. Not only two equal sides, the isosceles triangle also consists of two equal angles. The following figure is of the isosceles triangle</p>

    <h3>Scalene Triangle</h3>
    <p>The triangle with no equal sides is the scalene triangle. Each line of this triangle is of different length. Following is the figure of the scalene triangle:</p>
